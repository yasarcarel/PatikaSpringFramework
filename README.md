This repository contains small Spring Framework tasks i did during my internship at Trex Digital Manufacturing.
It contains basic webpages that are made so that i can understand and deepen my knowledge about backend work.
Every little concept and aspect has its unique webpage and its own package.
I tried to follow DRY , KISS and Clean Code principles so that it can be easly readen and understood ,if you spot any error on my part please let me know.
